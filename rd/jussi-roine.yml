  ## Bio
  My name is Jussi Roine, and I’m based in Helsinki, Finland. Having recently turned 40
  I think I’ve tackled the inevitable midlife crisis well, at least for now. 
  
  I’ve worked in all things IT for almost 30 years, having founded my first company in
  1991 at the ripe business age of 14. For the past 10 years I’ve worked as CTO for my
  own company that I we recently merged with our competitor. Today, the company is about
  100 people strong for which I’m a little bit proud of, in a quintessential Finnish way.
  As part of my duties I’m actively presenting at international events and I’ve gotten really,
  really good in doing my presentation slides at the last second. Things that resonate strongly
  with me include cloud architectures, complex technical and business challenges and being 
  outside my comfort zone. My only motivational and cheesy motto is "everything you’ve ever
  wanted is on the other side of fear" and I live by it. 
  
  I try and sometimes succeed in carving out some downtime for myself, that I then fill 
  with rock climbing and scavenging activities for memorable red wines.
